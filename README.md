A date calculator written in Swift v3

This was an initial project to put together some of the things learned about Swift into a relatively useful
app. Subsequently, it has been extended into a tabbed application, and converted to Swift v3. It has also been
used as an example for a demonstration of Swift and XCode for the Rochester Minnesota k-Lug Linux Users Group.

App Premise: The problem description: We get medicine on a fairly frequent basis, generally with refills each 90 days.
 After 75 days, the refill can be called in, and the new script is mailed out. So... Given the date on the bottle, what
would be the date 75 days in the future?

For this, we need the date on the bottle, and the number of days in the future that we'd like the date for. These are
the two fields on the first screen. Entering the number of days and touching "Calculate" will display the new date
in the window. Also, changing the starting date will cause the new date to change. If bad data is given (such as "10-10-10")
then the new date won't change.

The second tab at the bottom was added to allow two dates to be given, with the difference between the two dates
displayed as the result.

This app was used as the basis of the September 2016 presentation for the Rochester k-Lug meeting. More about k-Lug
